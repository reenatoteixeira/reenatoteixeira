## Hello, world! üëãüèª  
### Welcome to my GitHub profile  

I'm a **Product Owner** with nearly **3 years of experience leading the development of digital products in the logistics and B2B e-commerce space**. My day-to-day involves translating business needs into **workable technical solutions**, owning the product backlog, writing user stories, and facilitating collaboration between stakeholders and development teams. This has helped me develop a strong sense of how to build **scalable**, **user-centered**, and **high-impact** software.

But that‚Äôs not all ‚Äî I'm currently transitioning into **full-stack web development**, blending my understanding of product strategy with practical technical expertise to become a well-rounded Tech Lead in the near future. I'm also graduating in **Information Systems** and pursuing a post-graduate degree in **Software Engineering**, further strengthening my ability to bridge the gap between business and technology.
